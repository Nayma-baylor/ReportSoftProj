\label{sec:conclusion}

Our team was able to make Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Admin, Submitter, Lecturer, RPM, and Reviewer. We used JavaFX for creating GUI. Our main realization of using JavaFX is that it is not that efficient tool for creating GUI. We have also added a database in order to keep the record of the list of team, artifact, RPM, and Reviewer. We have also made sure that all our SQL queries prevent SQL injection threats. Moreover, we have used GitHub to control versions and maintain consistency. This evidently made it very easier to maintain the project. Our RPM and Reviewer GUI are not fully responsive and interactive yet, but we intend to work on that. One of our major future goals is to integrate the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model to our system \& to complete all the requirements for the project. Currently, our system defines the roles when registering but we want to design it in a more specialized way so that a user can play more than one role. By doing this, our system will be more effective and worthy.
