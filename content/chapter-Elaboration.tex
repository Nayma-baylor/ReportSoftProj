          \item Execution in Main Success Scenario step 5 continues.
    \end{enumerate}
    5a. System is unable to Publish Review because a part was not completed or data was
not received by the server:
\begin{enumerate}
        \itemsep-1em 
        \item System tells Reviewer what the error was with their attempted published
        submission.
        \item Since Review was not published, execution goes back to Main Success Scenario
         step 3.

    \subsection{Casual Use Cases:}
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 8: Review RPM (Rate RPM)}
    The Lecturer wants to rate the performance of an RPM after the RPM has managed the Review process for a given Artifact and left a review. The Lecturer wants to make a “Person Review” for this RPM based on how well they managed the review process for an Artifact submitted by a Team. The Lecturer wants to give a rating and possibly a description in this Person Review which will be associated with the RPM.
    \\
    \\
    First an RPM manages the review process for an Artifact submitted by a team. When all Reviewers have submitted their Reviews, the RPM also submits their own review. The Lecturer is notified about the RPM’s submitted Review and reviews the Artifact herself/himself. Finally, the Lecturer can review the RPM’s performance by creating a “Person Review” which includes a rating and a description of their performance. This “Person Review” is then available for the RPM and Lecturer to see.
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 9: Review Reviewer (Rate Reviewer) }
    The Lecturer wants to rate the performance of a Reviewer after the Reviewer has written a Review for a given Artifact and the RPM has also left their review. The Lecturer wants to make a “Person Review” for this Reviewer based on how well they did their job. The Lecturer wants to give a rating and possibly a description in this Person Review which will be associated with the Reviewer.
    \\
    \\
    First a Reviewer is assigned to review an Artifact submitted by a team. Once the Reviewer has submitted their Review and the RPM has submitted their review, the Lecturer is notified about the RPM’s submitted Review and reviews the Artifact herself/himself. Finally, the Lecturer can review the Reviewer’s performance by creating a “Person Review” which includes a rating and a description of their performance. This “Person Review” is then available for the Reviewer and Lecturer to see.
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 10: Setup Review Template  }
    The Admin wants to setup Review Templates for various documents to be easily reviewable. The Admin wants to associate specific Artifact Types with Review Templates so that when someone comes to Review an artifact of a given Artifact Type, they have a Review Template to follow.
    \\
    \\
    First created Review Templates must exist for the admin to add to the System. Next, the Admin can upload a Review Template to the System and specify for which Artifact Types it may be associated with. Now any Lecturer, RPM, or Reviewer may see these Review Templates when they go to review an Artifact of the associated Artifact type.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 11: Setup Notification Template  }
    The Admin wants to setup a Notification Template for any User to subscribe to a templatized set of Notifications. User’s want to be subscribed to receive Notifications to various information regarding their associations.
    \\
    \\
    First the Admin must be able to see all possible Notification Types, so that they may choose which Notifications should be present in a given Notification Template. The Admin may then create a new Notification Template. In this Template, they may select which Notifications should be enabled when a User is subscribed to this Template. The Admin can then submit the template which will become available for Users to see in their Notification settings. A User may then select a Notification Template to subscribe to so that they may receive certain types of Notifications which apply to them.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 12: Generate Report (Lecturer) }
    The Lecturer is logged into the system. He wants to generate a report on current/past assignments to RPMs/Reviewers. The lecturer sends a request to the system with the Name/ID of the RPM/Reviewer to see the report. The system retrieves all the records for the specified person and the specified type of assignment and sends the list to the Lecturer. The Lecturer then views the report and if the lecturer wants then he can print the report or save it.
    \\
    \\
    The lecturer wants to generate report for the history of artifact submitted by a team. The lecturer sends this request to the system with the team-name/submitter-name. The system retrieves all the records for the specified person/team and sends the list to the Lecturer. The Lecturer then views the report and if the lecturer wants then he can print the report or save it.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 13: Add Account }
    The Admin is logged into the system and gets a request to open a new account. The admin checks whether an account already exists for that person.Then the admin checks whether the person has the credentials for that account and the admin checks whether the information provided by the person is proper and correct.If yes, then the admin sets up verification link for that account. When verified, the account gets created and added to the system. The user gets notified.
    \\
    \\
    If the admin wants to deny the person of this request, then the admin cancels the request and the person gets notified.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 14: Modify Account }
    Admin is logged into the system and gets a request to modify an account. The admin checks whether the requested modification is valid or not. If valid, then the admin approves the modification, the system saves the modifications and then the user gets notified. 
    \\
    \\
    If the admin wants to deny the person of this request, then the admin cancels the request and the person gets notified.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 15: Remove Account }
    Admin is logged into the system and gets a request to remove an account. If it was on request,then the admin asks for confirmation and thenapprovesremoval ofthe account. The system deletes the records for that account. After removal of account the user gets notified. 
    \\
    \\
    If the admin wants to remove the account himself then heasks the system to remove the account, the system checks for constraints and thenremoves it if no constraints get violated. Otherwise the system notifies the admin of the error that might cause this to the system. Then the asks for confirmation from the admin. If the admin confirms then the system removes the account otherwise the system moves to a clean state.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 16: Manage User Account}
    This is basically composed of either of the above three use cases. A request to open a new account, modify an account or remove an account is handled by the Administrator. For this the admin has to be logged on into the system. And follow the set rules or procedures to fulfill the request and notification has to be sent after successful completion of the task. If a request cannot be fulfilled, then the requester has to be notified.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 17: View Results}
    The Submitter wants to view results after his/her submission. The Lecturer wants to make report about the submission after receiving the review from RPM. System wants to publish that result and wants to notify all team members including submitter.
    \\
    \\
    At first, Reviewer reviews the artifacts. After that RPM makes a report using these reviews. The Lecturer  receives  that  report  and  makes  a  final  report  which  is  the  final  result. Furthermore, Lecturer submits this result to the system. At last, the system publishes it and gives notification to the team members.
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 18: Submit Multiple Artifact for Review }
    Submitter  wants  to  submit  multiple  artifacts.  System  wants  to  make  separate  notification  for each  artifact  and  wants  to  notify the Lecturer.  System  also  wants  to  notify  the  submitter  in multiple times for receiving these artifacts. Lecturer wants to assign these artifacts to different RPMs. 
    \\
    \\
    At  first,  Submitter  submits  multiple  artifacts.  The  system  gives  notification  to the Lecturer separately for each artifact. The lecturer receives multiple notification for one submission. Then he/she  assigns  RPM  for  each  artifact.  At  last,  System  notifies  the  team  members  about  the confirmation of submission for each artifact.
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 19: View Artifact }
    Submitter wants  to  view  the  artifacts  which  have  been  submitted  by  him/her.  The  Reviewer wants  to  view  the  artifacts  that  are  assigned  to  him/her  by  RPM.  The  RPM  wants  to  view  the artifacts that are assigned to him/her by Lecturer. The Lecturer wants to view all the artifacts that have  been  submitted.  The  administrator  also  wants  to  view  all  the  artifacts  that  have  been submitted.
    \\
    \\
    First, Submitter has access to view only the artifacts that have been submitted by his/her team. Second,  Reviewer  has  access  toview  only  the  artifacts  that  have  been  assigned  to  them  for reviewing. Third, RPM has access to view only the artifacts that have been assigned to them by Lecturer. The Lecturer has access to all the artifacts and administrator has also access to all the artifacts.
    
    
    
    
    %ASKAR
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 20: Resolve Conflicting Reviews}
    If RPM in the UC6 decides that the reviews present conflicting views, then the RPM rejects the reviews and sets the deadline for conflict resolution. The system sends notifications to each reviewer assigned to the artifact that their reviews have conflict. Each reviewer reads reviews of other reviewers. The system creates discussion page for the reviews of the artifact. Then all reviewers discuss their viewpoints by leaving comments in the discussion page. Each time some reviewer leaves comment, the system sends notification all other reviewers of the artifact that comment was written. After reviewers come to consensus about their reviews, they modify their reviews and submit them. The system sends notification to the RPM that conflict was resolved.
    \\
    \\
    If reviewers don’t come to consensus about their reviews in a given deadline, then RPM extend the deadline for conflict resolution for 2-3 more days.If reviewers still don’t come to consensus after additional time, then RPM chooses the review( or reviews that don’t conflict) and rates the artifact.
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 21: Notify Person }
    Notification System notifies the users for different reasons. Submitter gets notifications every time he/she registers for team or submit artifact/artifacts for review or the results are ready to view. When the Review Project Manager (RPM) rates artifact the lecturerand reviewerswill get notified. The same thing will happen when the Reviewer reviews and rates artifact. So, UC9 is basically done after the completion of UC1, UC2, UC3, UC4, UC6 and UC8.
    \\
    \\
    If system wants to notify the user but the user account was deleted, then the system will notify the primary actor of the usecase that the user was deleted.
    
    
    
    
    \subsection*{Use Case 22: Setup Notification and Reminder }
    The admin has to setup the system to generate necessary notifications and reminders. When a new artifact gets submitted, the lecturer needs to be notified and keep on reminding until the artifact gets assigned to an RPM. When an artifact gets assigned to an RPM, notification has to be sent and reminder has to be set up until the artifact gets assigned to reviewers. When an artifact gets assigned to a reviewer, he/she hasto be notified and reminder has to be set up to remind him/her every day after the deadline, until the artifact gets reviewed. When reviews from all reviewers of an artifact are submitted, the RPM has to be notified and reminded every day until the artifact gets rated by an RPM. When an artifact gets rated by an RPM, the lecturer has to be notified and reminded every day until the artifact gets rated by the lecturer. When a review result for an artifact gets generated, the submitter(team) has to be notified.
    \\
    \\
    If administrator wants to setup notification or reminder, but there is no template for that notification or reminder, then administrator creates new notification or reminder template and sets up the notification or reminder.If administrator had setup the system to generate necessary notifications and reminders, but the system does not generate them, then administrator should manually generate notification to every user that system is not working. Then administrator should stop the system and call the system developer to fix the problem.
